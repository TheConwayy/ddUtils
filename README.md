# ddUtils

A simple FiveM resource that contains utilities used by Duck Development resources

# Information

This script, developed under the alias "Duck Development", is a utility script for the popular GTA Modding framework, FiveM.

Made completely in the [LUA programming language](https://www.lua.org/), using [FiveM natives](https://docs.fivem.net/natives/), it is super to understand and make any edits to.

Most resources made by Duck Development will require this script. It is highly recommended that you make sure that you keep this up-to-date.

# Configuration

There is a simple "config.lua" file with everything that could be needed for such a simple script.

In the file, everything is explained, and if you ever need support, you can always use one of the means of contact listed below

# Support/Contact

If you ever need support, the easiest way to receive it would be through the [Duck Development Discord](https://discord.gg/3rMN9uZAnf). In here, I am available to answer any questions, alongside other members of our support team who are run down on how everything with out resources work. Only the best support is provided.
